# Project Management
Put all the contents of the downloaded files in the "project" folder in the "C" drive, then run it by adding project in Qt(you can run project_management.exe file without Qt but "Qt5Cored.dll", "Qt5Guid.dll" and "Qt5Widgetsd.dll" files must be downloaded and replace to project_management.exe folder).
By using this program, you can make changes according to your access level in the project, for example access level:
Level 4: can see status, 
Level 3: level 4 + add or subtrack tasks, 
Level 2: level 4 + assign tasks, 
Level 1: ability to make any changes
